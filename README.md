Demo code for using an Arduino with a Raspberry Pi. Building off of a [starting point from Simon Monk](http://www.doctormonk.com/2012/04/raspberry-pi-and-arduino.html), I'm exploring ways to use the Arduino as a hub for sensors into the Raspberry Pi.

Likely enhancements include JSON serialization of data and on-the-fly reconfiguration of sensors.
